# What is a `queue`?

A queue:
- is a *non-primitive* **_linear_** data structure
- follows **FIFO**-principle:
  - First element added will be the first element removed

---

## Basic Operations

> For ease of typing, `E` will denote the type of data stored within the queue

### Insertion

- `void enqueue(E element)`
  - Adds the element to the queue at first available position

### Deletion

- `E dequeue()`
    - Removes and returns the first element within the queue

### Traversal

Traversal through the queue depends on the following factors:
- does the implementation provide a way of traversing the underlying data structure?
-

## Types

### Linear Queue

A queue that handles elements in a linear fashion, strictly following the FIFO-principle

### Priority Queue

A queue where each element is wrapped with a quantifiable priority

### Circular Queue
